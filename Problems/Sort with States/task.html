  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Sort with States</h2> 
  <p>You're given an array of elements. Your task is to sort it in ascending order using a binary heap. Print not only the sorted array but also the initial state of the heap and its states after extracting every element.</p> 
  <p><br> <strong>Input:</strong> The first line contains N, that is the length of the array. In the next line, there are elements of the array. These are the integers that don't exceed <span class="math-tex">\(10^9\)</span> in absolute value (<span class="math-tex">\(1\leq N \leq 100\)</span>).</p> 
  <p><br> <strong>Output:</strong> In the first line print the heap that was constructed after calling <code class="java">minHeap()</code>, and in the following N â€“ 1 lines print heap states after removing the next element. In the last (N + 1) line print the sorted array.</p>
