<h2>Multiple sequence alignment</h2>

  <p>For now, we considered the algorithm that allows finding an alignment only for two strings. But the algorithm can be extended for finding an alignment for a bigger number of sequences. Your task here is to implement an algorithm that builds an optimal alignment for three strings.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input</strong>: three strings $s, t$ and $u$: $|s|, |t|, |u| \le 20$.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output</strong>: an optimal alignment for the strings. Use the following costs for the edit operations:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>insertion/deletion: 2</li> 
   <li>substitution: 1 (for equal symbols use 0)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>An alignment for three strings contains three symbols in each column. The cost of each column depends on how many different symbols are in a column. For example, if there are three different letters in a column, the cost of such a column is 3, since all three possible pairs of letters cost 1. If there are two gap symbols and a letter in a column, the cost of such a column is 4, since each of the gap symbols with a letter costs 2, and the gaps symbols itself are considered to be equal.</p>

   When finding the edit distance for two strings, we use a 2d-table to store intermediate answers. So, how can we store intermediate answers for three strings?
